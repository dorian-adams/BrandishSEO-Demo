## Purpose

## What I Learned
In working on this project, I gained valuable first-hand experience with many core aspects of Django development. Including class-based views, function-based views, creating mix-ins for modularity and DRY, forms, storage, custom user models, ORM, Python scripting, authentication, performance optimization, deployment, and more. Most importantly, I developed this project from idea to deployment. In doing so, I learned how to work through challenges, debug, and see a project to completion.
